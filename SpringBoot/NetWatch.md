#### üìå Since you already have Spring Boot, Kafka, Keycloak, PostgreSQL, Docker experience, I‚Äôd suggest we go Java for the main backend and Python for the network/ML parts.
- That way:
    - Java handles the collector service, APIs, dashboard backend, authentication.
    - Python handles packet sniffing agents and ML anomaly detection (much easier than doing ML in Java).
    - Both communicate via Kafka.
    - This hybrid stack will let you use your existing skills while picking up Python for the more data-science-heavy parts.
